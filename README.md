# The most concise DFS Binary-tree traversal
Includes: In-order search, Pre-order search, and Post-order search(Reversed search not included)
```
My binary tree:
         1
       /   \
      2     3
     / \   / \
    4   5 6   7

Pre-order:      1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7
    Start from root, then move to left, then move to right

In-order:       4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 7
    Start from left, then move to root, then move to right.

Post-order:     4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1
    Start from left, then move to right, then move to root.
```
